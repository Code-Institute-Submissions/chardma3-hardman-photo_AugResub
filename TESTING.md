<span id="bugs"></span>

## 4. Bugs Fixed

1. Upon first submission the correct database was not connected - This was fixed by adding an env.py file. I've spoken to a couple of tutors how this could've happened but it's still unclear as to why I tested the website all day whilst writing the testing readme and then 5 min before submission it reverted to a db that I had deleted. The workspace was always pinned but the env.py file was not there. Upon adding that it worked as expected. 

2. Custom error pages weren't working because of typos. I fixed these and added formatting and extra styling. I was able to trigger the 404 page by typing an unknown address appnded to the regular heroku url.

3. When filling in details for payment there was a spinning icon in the bottom left corner and the form did not go through. Checkout.css was not connected. The checkout.css url was missing. Upon adding the block css it worked as expected.

## 4. Bugs Unresolved

1. The product input field in the shopping bag app should only be allowed to go to 0. However due to time constraints I was unable to find a way to fix this. 

2. The email order confirmation is not being sent. Due to time constraints I was unable to fix this.

3. In the profile page and order history page the item name has the word 'size' after the 'name'. For some reason it is not showing the exact size that was selected. Due to time constraints I was unable to fix this.

4. My mentor Precious pointed out that upon entering a decimal number in the input field the app crashes. Due to time constraints I was unable to fix this.

<span id="future-testing"></span>

## 5. Future testing 

Testing is obviously a massive part of developing a web application. Some argue that as much time should be spent testing the application as should be devloping the application. In the future, with more time and knowlegde I would like to improve the testing and resolve the bugs that are still present.
