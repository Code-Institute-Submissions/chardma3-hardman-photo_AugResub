## 5. Browser compatibility

<span id="other"></span>

## 8. Other

- During developing the website the debugger in `settings.py` was set to `debug=True`. The **debugger** showed errors and allowed me to find the errors quickly and to fix it.
- Custom error pages for error 400, 403, 404 and 500 are showing up in the same design as the website. 
- Url access/ security is test. The results: 
    - Pages that not exists are headed to a 404 page. 
    - Users who visit pages that require login while the user is not logged in will be directed to the login page.
    - Users who want to visit superuser access pages are getting redirected to the login page.

<span id="bugs"></span>

## 7. Bugs 

1. A bug was found in the interactive elements of the website. Certain elements didn't works especially collapse and dropdown elements.
    - I checked the links of Bootstrap and found out that I was using two versions of Bootstrap (Version 4 and version 5) at the same time. That why some elements didn't interact on the website. I fixed this bug to change every element to Bootstrap 5. 
2. A bug was found in with a unexpected 404 message on the products page in my 8000 port. 
    - This problem sometimes occurs when I added a product to the cart and then delete the product from the database. This action causes my 404 error. I have solved this bug by opening the Dev Tools and cleaned the site data.

<span id="future-testing"></span>

## 8. Future testing 

Testing is a big part that has to be done after you created the project. For in the future with more time and knowlegde I would like to impove testing and make the quality of the project better. 
For in the future I would like to improve mostrly two things: 
- I would like to improve the automated testing with testing the apps looking at `views`, `models`, and `forms'. My coverage at this moment is 41% and I would like to impove this to a minimum of 80%.
- I would like to improve the results of the lighthouse scores, especially the performance score. The performance score is 66 and I would like to improve that to a minimum score of 90. Therefore I have to dive into the requirements and improve these elements.
